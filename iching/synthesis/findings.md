## Central Thread

Structure → incompleteness → curvature → specificity → meaning.

The hexagram system (Z₂⁶) supports exactly two primitive projections — shell (trigram pair) and core (nuclear overlap) — proven algebraically, confirmed historically. Two divination traditions (火珠林, 梅花) exhaust these projections. They are orthogonal instruments that cannot see each other's signals. The system creates structured incompleteness at every level — missing types, seasonal ceilings, rotating shadows — and this incompleteness is the mechanism of discrimination, not a defect.

Two bridges connect the algebra to the oldest textual layer:
1. **凶×basin** (core channel): algebraic irreversibility (convergence to absorbing attractor) maps to textual irreversibility (凶). p=0.0002.
2. **吉×生体** (shell channel): receiving generation (用 nourishes 體) maps to auspiciousness (吉). p=0.007, basin-independent.

Both bridges encode *process* (convergence, generation), not *state* (element identity, category membership). The texts track the direction of flow, not the labels on the nodes.

## 1. The Decisive Test: What the 卦辭/爻辭 Revealed

### Decision: MIXED — Layer-Dependent

The oldest textual layers of the I Ching partially encode algebraic structure, but only through two narrow channels: the placement of 凶 and the distribution of 吉 relative to 體/用 flow direction. All deeper algebraic constructs are invisible to the texts at the semantic level.

### Confirmed Results

**Embedding-space tests (A–D, G): All null.**
- Basin → 卦辭 embedding: no clustering (p=0.73)
- Palace → 卦辭 embedding: no clustering (p=0.49)
- I-component → 卦辭 embedding: no clustering (p=0.47)
- Kernel (O,M,I) → 卦辭 embedding: no effect (p=0.47)
- 互卦 pairing → semantic similarity: no signal, trend anti-correlated (Δ=−0.014, p=0.92)

The algebraic structure of the binary encoding does not predict what the judgment texts *say*.

**Valence × line position (Test E): Expected signal.**
- 吉 × line: p=0.0002; 凶 × line: p=0.0013; 无咎 × line: p=0.034; 厲 × line: p=0.047
- Line position carries valence meaning — well-known in the tradition (初=beginning, 上=excess, 二/五=central).

**凶 × algebraic coordinates: The core bridge.**
- 凶 × basin: χ²=17.44, p=0.0002
- 凶 × I-component: χ²=16.22, p=0.0001
- Basin and I-component are **identical partitions** on Z₂⁶: I=0 ↔ {Kun, Qian} basins, I=1 ↔ Cycle basin
- **Direction**: Kun basin 20.8% 凶, Qian basin 20.8% 凶, Cycle basin **6.3%** 凶
- Fixed-point basins carry 3.3× the 凶 rate of the Cycle basin
- Effect persists after controlling for line position; strongest at outer positions (lines 1, 2, 6)
- 凶 is the **only** valence marker with basin significance; all others p>0.10

**Upper/lower trigram relation (Test H): Significant.**
- Kruskal-Wallis H=32.34, p<0.0001
- Hexagrams grouped by five-phase relation (比和, 生体, 体生用, 克体, 体克用) show different within-group semantic similarities
- This is a shallow algebraic feature — the trigram-pair relationship the tradition explicitly uses

**Additional textual layers:**
- 大象 (Image commentary): clusters by **palace** (p=0.027) — expected, since 大象 explicitly names trigram pairs
- 彖傳 (Judgment commentary): clusters by **basin** (p=0.045) — the structural commentary detects the I-bit partition
- 卦辭 semantic content: no clustering by any algebraic partition

### Interpretation

**The inversion.** The algebra says I=0 → 生 tendency → convergence to fixed points (pure stasis). The texts say I=0 → 凶. Danger is not where 克 (conflict) dominates, but where 生 (harmony) drives the system toward pure extremes. The process of losing dynamism — the approach to stasis — is where irreversible harm concentrates.

**Why only 凶?** 凶 is the only valence marker denoting irreversibility. All others (吉, 悔, 吝, 无咎, 厲) are navigational — they indicate states that can be worked with. The algebraic property of irreversibility (convergence to absorbing attractor) maps onto the textual property of irreversibility (凶). This structural correspondence explains the selectivity: reversible markers have no corresponding algebraic invariant in the basin structure.

**Three channels, one structure.** The I-bit partition surfaces through three independent channels:
1. 爻辭 凶 placement (~9th c. BC) — distributional encoding
2. 彖傳 semantic clustering (~5th-3rd c. BC) — structural commentary language
3. Algebraic basin partition (京房, ~1st c. BC) — formal mathematical structure

The 彖傳 likely propagates through trigram-relational language (structural channel), not by echoing 凶 counts — since the 卦辭 (equally downstream of 爻辭) doesn't cluster. The temporal separation (700+ years between 爻辭 and algebraic formalization) argues that the encoding predates the formalization.

**The tautology.** 易 means "change." The system marks the extinction of change (convergence to fixed point) as its deepest danger (凶). The algebraic and textual traditions agree: creation is a process, never a destination; arrival at stasis is where irreversible harm occurs.

### Depth Gradient — Confirmed

The 凶 rate within I=0 follows a non-monotonic depth gradient (χ²=8.63, p=0.013):

| Depth | Category | Hexagrams | 凶/total | Rate |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| 0 | Attractors (乾 坤) | 2 | 0/12 | 0.000 |
| 1 | Penultimate (剝 復 頤 大過 夬 姤) | 6 | 13/36 | 0.361 |
| 2 | Deep I=0 | 24 | 27/144 | 0.188 |
| — | Cycle (I=1) | 32 | 12/192 | 0.063 |

**All three predictions confirmed:**
1. **Qian and Kun contain zero 凶** — the attractors themselves are beyond danger
2. **Depth-1 hexagrams carry the highest 凶 rate** (36.1%) — the penultimate moment before absorption is most dangerous
3. **Gradient shape 0% → 36% → 19% → 6%** — non-monotonic peak at the boundary layer

**Structural reading:** The attractors are not dangerous because they *are* stasis — danger is past. Depth-1 hexagrams are the boundary layer where absorption is imminent but not yet complete; every depth-1 hexagram has 凶 in at least one line (range: 1–3 of 6 lines). The six depth-1 hexagrams (剝 復 頤 大過 夬 姤) are traditionally recognized as liminal or extreme — the depth gradient confirms this is algebraically grounded, not merely interpretive convention.

### Depth Boundary: Distributional, Not Thematic (Probe 7)

The 凶×basin signal is **distributional** — WHERE 凶 appears — not **thematic** — what the 凶 texts SAY. Analysis of word frequencies in 凶 texts by depth category shows no significant differentiation:

| Word group | depth-1 rate | others rate | p-value |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| threshold (終, 極, 窮, 盡) | 0.143 | 0.000 | 0.069 |
| irreversibility (不可, 滅, 亡) | 0.071 | 0.105 | 1.000 |
| transformation (反, 復, 變) | 0.143 | 0.026 | 0.173 |
| excess (過, 大, 盈) | 0.143 | 0.158 | 1.000 |

Threshold words (終, 極, 窮) show a marginal trend (p=0.069) but with only 52 total 凶 texts, statistical power is limited. The depth-1 凶 texts are dominated by 剝 (3 凶 lines: systematic peeling away) and 頤 (3 凶 lines: nourishment extremes) — both thematically liminal, but this is circumstantial, not statistically confirmed.

The bridge from algebra to text is through *placement frequency*, not through *content modulation*. The algebra constrains WHERE 凶 concentrates; the specific imagery within 凶 texts is textually determined.

## 2. The Curvature of the Reading Space

### The Orthogonality Wall (Probe 2) — Refined

**The wall holds at the 納甲 level, not the element level.** This distinction matters:

- **納甲** branch assignments factor through trigram *identity* — they read bits [0:2] and [3:5] independently as trigram labels, then assign branches by lookup. The branch system is **perfectly orthogonal** to the inner bits (b₁..b₄) that determine basin and depth.

- **Trigram elements** are a coarser projection that maps 8 trigrams → 5 elements. Because elements are determined by all 3 bits of each trigram, the element assignment carries partial information about the boundary bits b₂ and b₃ that also determine basin membership. The 體/用 relation (which uses trigram elements) **leaks approximately 7% basin information** through these shared boundary bits.

Concretely: 比和 hexagrams (same element in both trigrams) are enriched in fixed-point basins (57.1% vs 50% baseline), while 生体/体生用 hexagrams are depleted (41.7%). This leakage means any signal through 體/用 must be checked for basin confounding before being called independent.

The contextual obstruction measure (dark contexts where F=0 for a given season × 用神 pair) does not correlate with 凶. All three measures — n_zero, F_variance, F_total — fail to reach significance. The *reason* they fail is the orthogonality wall:

**F_total = 12 for all 64 hexagrams.** A conservation law: each line's element is 旺/相 in exactly 2 of 5 seasons, and each line belongs to exactly one 六親 type. So 6 lines × 2 seasons = 12 active slots, invariant across hexagrams.

**n_zero ∈ {15, 17, 19} with distribution 16:32:16.** This maps exactly to the number of missing 六親 types (0, 1, 2 missing types → 15, 17, 19 dark contexts). The 16:32:16 ratio matches the huozhulin finding that 16 hexagrams have 0 missing types, 32 have 1, 16 have 2.

**No correlation with 凶:**
- n_zero vs 凶: ρ=0.12, p=0.34
- F_variance vs 凶: ρ=−0.06, p=0.65
- n_zero by basin: H=2.95, p=0.23
- F_variance by basin: H=2.08, p=0.35

**The wall.** The null result is predicted by the 納甲 ⊥ 互卦 orthogonality:

- **凶 lives in the inner bits** (b₂, b₃): basin, depth, I-component
- **六親 × 旺相 lives in the trigram pair** (outer projection): 納甲 assigns branch elements based on trigram identity, which reads bits [0:3] and [3:6] independently

These are **algebraically orthogonal projections** of Z₂⁶. No measure built from 六親 × seasonal strength can access basin/depth information, because the 火珠林 operational layer is structurally blind to the inner-bit dynamics that govern 凶 placement.

### Three Sources of Curvature

The presheaf of reading contexts (season × 用神 × hexagram) has no global section. Three independent sources of curvature contribute:

1. **Palace incompleteness** = holes. 6/8 palaces permanently missing 2 of 5 六親 types. Topological defects — fixed by the hexagram, immovable.
2. **Seasonal ceiling** = torsion. The Z₅ 生克 cycle forces a width-2 window on a size-5 ring: exactly 2/5 elements strong at any time. Softened by 日辰 to 4/5 (see §4), but never eliminated.
3. **用神 projection** = dimensional reduction. The question collapses 5 六親 types → 1 signal type. Information loss depends on viewing angle.

**Scale dependence.** The obstruction is invisible at scale 1. One context = one clean reading. Curvature appears at larger scales: 2 seasons → 旺/相 windows don't align. 2 用神 types → signal for one question is noise for another. The inter-context disagreements *are* the structural content.

**The design question.** A flat system (H¹ = 0) gives the same answer from every angle — a lookup table. A curved system (H¹ ≠ 0) gives different answers from different angles — the *pattern of variation* across contexts is the reading. The structured gaps are what make the system discriminative. If all 5 六親 types were always present and strong, every reading says "everything is active" — zero bits of information. The curvature is the information channel.

### Structural Discoveries

1. **F_total conservation** (= 12): a previously unknown invariant arising from the double bijection (六親→element, season→2 active elements)
2. **n_zero is determined by missing-type count**: the 16:32:16 distribution of n_zero values is the same 1:2:1 binomial structure found in huozhulin Probe 3
3. **The seasonal system adds no hexagram-specific obstruction**: the "seasonal zeros" count is constant at 15 for all hexagrams with 0 missing types — the seasonal layer redistributes the 12 active slots but creates no differential opacity

---

## 3. Where Meaning Enters (用神/體用)

### The Discrimination Architecture

The discrimination mechanism has three layers:

1. **Hexagram** → which 六親 types exist (structural filter, algebraic) — **formalized**
2. **Season/day** → which existing types are strong (temporal filter, algebraic) — **formalized**
3. **Question** → which type is signal (intentional filter, semantic) — **now formalized** (Probe 3)

Layer 3 is the primary projection — it collapses the 5-dimensional 六親 space to a 1-dimensional signal/noise split. Without it, the structural and temporal incompleteness has no meaning (a missing type only matters if it's the one you need).

### The Querrent's Geometric Position

The querrent (兄弟 = self, same element as palace) sits on the 克 cycle between the two heaviest 用神 types:

```
官鬼(8) →克→ 兄弟(0) →克→ 父母(3) →克→ 妻財(7) →克→ 子孫(4) →克→ 官鬼
```

兄弟 has 0 domains — it is the **reference frame**, never the object of inquiry. You don't divine about yourself; you divine about what acts on you (官鬼), what you seek (妻財), what you tend (子孫), what shelters you (父母). The querrent is the excluded node: '破財之人，不為主、不為輔.'

官鬼 (8 domains) + 妻財 (7 domains) = 15/22 = 68% of all question domains.

### The Triad Formalization

Each 用神 operates within a diagnostic triad: auxiliary = σ⁻¹(X) (what generates the 用神 on the 六親 cycle), 忌神 = what 克s the 用神.

| 用神 | Domains | Auxiliary (σ⁻¹) | 忌神 (what 克s 用) |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| 官鬼 | 8 | 妻財 | 子孫 |
| 妻財 | 7 | 子孫 | 父母 |
| 子孫 | 4 | 兄弟 | 妻財 |
| 父母 | 3 | 官鬼 | 兄弟 |
| 兄弟 | 0 | 父母 | 官鬼 |

The triad (用神, auxiliary, 忌神) is the minimal diagnostic unit. Whether a hexagram provides a complete reading depends on which triad members are present.

### Structural Symmetry, Projective Asymmetry

**The temporal system is perfectly symmetric.** Every 用神 type is suppressed (囚/死) in exactly 2/5 of seasonal contexts and 克ed by 1/5 of daily elements. The 五行 cycle's Z₅ symmetry ensures no type is systematically favored or penalized temporally. This uniformity is algebraically necessary — each element occupies each strength level in exactly one season.

**ALL asymmetry enters through the 用神 projection.** The 8:7:4:3:0 domain weighting is where the system becomes non-uniform. This means: the structural space (Z₂⁶ algebra, palace incompleteness, seasonal rotation) treats all 六親 types equally. It is the mapping from human concerns to 六親 types that creates differential difficulty.

### Gen Palace as Darkest — The Structural Darkness Gradient

When a palace is missing a 六親 type, all question domains mapped to that type become structurally unreadable:

| Palace | Missing types | Domains affected | Fraction of 22 |
|--------|---------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| Gen ☶ | 妻財(7) + 官鬼(8) | 15 | **68%** |
| Zhen ☳ | 子孫(4) + 官鬼(8) | 12 | 55% |
| Li ☲ | 兄弟(0) + 妻財(7) | 7 | 32% |
| Dui ☱ / Xun ☴ | 兄弟(0) + 子孫(4) | 4 | 18% |
| Kan ☵ | 兄弟(0) + 父母(3) | 3 | 14% |
| Kun ☷ / Qian ☰ | — | 0 | 0% |

Gen ☶ (missing the two heaviest types) is structurally dark for 68% of domains. Palaces where 兄弟 is one of the missing types have effective darkness halved — 兄弟's absence costs nothing because it has 0 domains.

### The Triad Diagnostic Gradient

Of 256 (hexagram × 用神) diagnostic contexts:

| Category | Count | Fraction | Meaning |
|----------|------:|----------|---------|
| Full | 116 | 45.3% | Signal + support + threat all present |
| Exposed | 42 | 16.4% | Signal + threat, no support |
| Unguarded | 42 | 16.4% | Signal + support, no threat |
| Isolated | 5 | 2.0% | Signal only |
| Blind | 51 | 19.9% | Signal absent — structural impossibility |

The diagnostic environment is not binary (can/cannot read) but **graded**. 45% of contexts provide full diagnostic information; 20% are structurally impossible; 35% are degraded in specific ways. This gradient is the mechanism through which structural incompleteness becomes differential meaning — not by preventing readings entirely, but by controlling how much diagnostic context is available.

### 兄弟's Benign Absence

兄弟 is missing from 13/64 hexagrams (4 palaces) but has 0 domains — its absence never blocks a question. When paired with another missing type, it effectively halves the darkness. This makes the incompleteness less severe than it appears: roughly half the missing-pair combinations include the zero-weight type.

### 火珠林 vs 梅花: Who Selects the Projection?

火珠林 lets the **question** select the projection (用神). The 30+ domain sections are a **practitioner's atlas** mapping the presheaf curvature from the questioner's perspective. 梅花 lets the **hexagram** select the projection (體用) via the 動爻 position.

| | 梅花 | 火珠林 |
|---|---|---|
| **Projection** | Hexagram selects (體用) | Question selects (用神) |
| **Time** | Encodes into question | Encodes into resolution |
| **Reads** | Core (becoming) | Shell (being) |
| **Ceiling** | 2/5 (seasonal only) | 4/5 (seasonal + 日辰) |

### Practitioner Navigation

Skilled practitioners implicitly navigate the presheaf curvature:
- Knowing which season favors which question type (用神 × season alignment)
- Knowing when 日辰 overrides seasonal suppression (local patch switching)
- Knowing which palaces structurally lack which types (topology of holes)
- Advising *when* to ask certain questions (choosing favorable contexts)

## 4. The Ceiling and Its Escape

### Decision: POSITIVE — ceiling broken to 4/5 (theorem)

日辰 (daily branch, Z₁₂) breaks the 2/5 seasonal ceiling. The maximum number of simultaneously active 六親 types rises from 2 to 4. This is proven as a theorem, not just observed computationally.

### The 4/5 Ceiling Theorem

**Theorem.** In the joint (season × day-branch) system, at most 4 of 5 elements can be simultaneously promotable. This bound is tight.

**Proof.** The seasonal 旺/相 pair = {i, i+1} in the 生 cycle (Z₅). The day pair = {j, SHENG_MAP[j]} = {j, j+1}. Two consecutive pairs in Z₅ cover at most 4 of 5 nodes (2+2, with possible overlap). The maximum is achieved when the pairs are disjoint. ∎

**Which element is excluded?** At maximum coverage, the seasonal complement is {i+2, i+3, i+4}. The only disjoint day-pairs within this arc are {i+2, i+3} and {i+3, i+4}. Both include i+3 (= 囚, the overcomer of the season). The excluded element alternates between:
- **休** (i+2): the element that generated the season — the exhausted source
- **死** (i+4): the element the season overcomes — the conquered object

The system can illuminate everything except one form of the past: either what gave rise to the present (休), or what the present has already overcome (死). Opposition (囚) is always representable at maximum reach.

### Computational Results

Across 3840 (season × day-branch × hexagram) states:

| Active types | States | Fraction |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| 0/5 | 29 | 0.8% |
| 1/5 | 522 | 13.6% |
| 2/5 | 1711 | 44.6% |
| 3/5 | 1352 | 35.2% |
| 4/5 | 226 | 5.9% |

The modal outcome remains 2/5 (44.6%), but 41.1% of states exceed the old ceiling.

At element level (60 season × day-branch pairs): set size 2 in 20%, size 3 in 40%, size 4 in 40%. Day element falls outside seasonal 旺/相 in 60% of pairs.

### Cycle Basin Conflict Resolution

Fire AND Water simultaneously promotable in 16/60 (27%) of (season, day-branch) pairs. The "permanent internal conflict" of the Cycle basin attractors (Fire↔Water mutual 克) is partially resolved by 日辰 — in roughly a quarter of temporal contexts, both elements of the oscillating attractor are accessible.

### Pipeline Asymmetry

- **梅花** encodes time into *the question*: temporal input selects which hexagram is cast (先天起卦 modular arithmetic). Curvature is in the state space.
- **火珠林** encodes time into *the answer's resolution*: temporal input (日辰) selects which aspects of a fixed hexagram are visible. Curvature is in the observation space.

One curves the domain, the other curves the codomain. The 2/5 vs 4/5 difference is a consequence of this architectural difference, not an independent fact.

梅花 does NOT use 日辰 branch mechanisms (沖, 暗動, 日辰生). It inherits the 2/5 ceiling identically.

梅花 temporal distribution: all 64 hexagrams accessible (100%), but non-uniform (χ² = 481.8, df=63). Two frequency classes separated by ~2× factor.

### Orthogonality Wall — Untouched

日辰 enriches the shell (Z₅ → Z₁₂ resolution) but cannot bridge to the core. 納甲 assigns branches by reading trigram pairs; 日辰 operates on those branches. Both are shell-level. The 凶 signal (inner bits / basin / depth) remains invisible to the operational layer regardless of 日辰.

```
             Z₂⁶
            /    \
     Shell (trig pair)    Core (inner bits)
       ↓                    ↓
   納甲 → branches       互卦 → basins
       ↓                    ↓
   六親 × 旺相 × 日辰     凶 / depth
       ↓                    ↓
   2/5 ceiling            convergence
   (softened to 4/5)      (unreachable)
```

### Curvature Update

The three curvature sources are now better characterized:

1. **Palace incompleteness** (holes): unchanged by 日辰. Static, hexagram-determined.
2. **Seasonal ceiling** (torsion): softened from 3/5 shadow to 1/5 shadow by 日辰, but never eliminated. The residual 1/5 exclusion is the minimal aperture — **proven as theorem**.
3. **用神 projection** (dimensional reduction): unchanged. Question-determined.

日辰 reduces one source of curvature without touching the other two. The residual curvature is sufficient for discrimination: when the 用神's element is the one excluded element, the hexagram cannot answer that question in that temporal context. The probability of this "shadow hit" is 1/5 at maximum coverage. This rotating shadow — one element always dark, rotating with the day — is the mechanism's aperture, not its defect.

---

## 5. Symmetry and Semantics (S₄ × 五行)

### The Three-Layer Decomposition of 五行 (from wuxing workflow)

**Status: proven.** H(五行) = 2.2500 bits, decomposing as:

| Layer | Feature | Information | Type |
|-------|---------|------------|------|
| 1 | b₀⊕b₁ parity | 1.0000 bits | Algebraic (linear) |
| 2 | b₀ within parity-0 coset | 0.7500 bits | Algebraic (linear) |
| 3 | Complement pair choice in parity-1 coset | 0.5000 bits | Cosmological |

**Layer 1** separates {Earth, Metal} (stable) from {Wood, Fire, Water} (dynamic). This IS the I-component at trigram level — the same bit that governs 生/克 separation, basin membership, and 凶 placement.

**Layer 3** is the sole non-algebraic input: the choice to keep {Zhen, Xun} together as Wood (rather than {Kan, Li}). This choice is resolved by Later Heaven compass alignment. Traditional 五行 ranks top 1.2% (5th of 420 possible {2,2,2,1,1} partitions) for compass alignment while respecting elemental identity.

### Connection to the 凶 Bridge

The I-component (Probe 1's 凶×basin bridge) is Layer 1 of the 五行 decomposition. This means:

- **生-exclusive XOR masks** {011, 100} **preserve** b₀⊕b₁ parity
- **克-exclusive XOR masks** {010, 110} **break** b₀⊕b₁ parity
- I=0 (parity-homogeneous interface) → 生-dominated convergence → fixed-point basins → **high 凶**
- I=1 (parity-broken interface) → 克-dominated dynamics → Cycle basin → **low 凶**

The parity that separates 生 from 克 in the 五行 geometry is the same parity that separates high-凶 from low-凶 basins in the textual tradition. The algebraic mechanism (parity preservation/violation) and the textual signal (凶 concentration) are two readings of the same invariant.

### The Complement Anti-Automorphism (Probe 5)

**Status: proven.** The complement permutation π = (Earth↔Metal)(Fire↔Water)(Wood) conjugates the 生 cycle to its inverse:

**π ∘ σ ∘ π⁻¹ = σ⁻¹**

Verified for all 5 elements. Complement reverses all directed edges in the 五行 graph, yielding three consequences at the hexagram level:

- 比和 → 比和 (identity preserved)
- 生体 ↔ 体生用 (direction of generation reverses)
- 克体 ↔ 体克用 (direction of overcoming reverses)
- **The 比/生/克 category is always preserved** (0% category disruption across 32 complement pairs)

The complement₆ transition matrix is perfectly block-diagonal: complement swaps "who generates whom" but preserves *whether* generation or overcoming is occurring.

### Parity Preservation Under Complement — Hypothesis Corrected

**Complement preserves b₀⊕b₁ parity universally** (8/8 trigrams). This is algebraically necessary: XOR with 111 flips both b₀ and b₁, so b₀'⊕b₁' = (b₀⊕1)⊕(b₁⊕1) = b₀⊕b₁.

Complement belongs to the *shared* XOR mask vocabulary (used by both 生 and 克), not the 克-exclusive set. The 克-exclusive masks {010, 110} break parity by flipping exactly one of {b₀, b₁}. Complement flips both, canceling the effect. Reverse (b₀↔b₂ swap) is mixed: preserves parity only for palindromic trigrams (b₀=b₂).

| Involution | Parity preservation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| complement | **8/8** (universal) |
| reverse | 4/8 (palindromes only) |
| rev∘comp | 4/8 |

### The Semantic Gap — Concrete > Abstract

The kwprobe semantic gap (Tuan embeddings) across the three involutions:

| Involution | Semantic similarity | 比/生/克 category disruption | Element set disruption |
|-----------|:------------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| reverse₆ | 0.720 | 50% | 79% |
| complement₆ | 0.680 | **0%** | 78% |
| rev∘comp₆ | 0.673 | 50% | 100% |

Complement has the *lowest* category disruption (0%) but only *middle* semantic similarity. The Tuan perceives concrete identity over abstract relational structure. The semantic hierarchy is:

**Visual flip** (0.720) > **category-preserving element change** (0.680) > **full disruption** (0.673)

The gap between reverse and complement is the difference between concrete similarity (same hexagram shape, different orientation) and abstract structural analogy (same interaction type, different elements). This confirms the Layer 2→3 gap: algebra constrains but does not generate semantic content.

### Wood as Fixed Point and Cycle Conjugator

Wood is the unique element closed under complement (Zhen↔Xun both Wood). It is the fixed point of the anti-automorphism — the hinge where the 生 cycle reverses to 克. Wood intrudes into both fixed-point basins via the overlap's free bit, creating 克 friction at every convergence step. Without Wood, convergence would be frictionless. The cosmological choice to keep {Zhen, Xun} as one element preserves this bridge — the system needs Wood whole.

### MI Decomposition Corrected (Probe 5)

MI(五行, complement pair partition) = 1.500 bits (67%). The 0.750 bits lost is the **within-pair element identity** (Layer 2: Earth vs Metal in two pairs, Fire vs Water in one), **not** the cosmological choice (Layer 3, which is preserved — complement pairs distinguish {Zhen,Xun}=Wood from {Kan,Li}={Fire,Water}).

As a function (not partition), complement preserves ALL 五行 information: MI = 2.250 = H(五行). The complement is a perfect permutation on elements. The 1.500 of the pair partition reflects loss of *which member you are*, not structural degradation.

| Involution | Pair MI | Function MI | H(五行 \| partner) |
|-----------|:-------:|:----------:|:------------------:|
| complement | 1.500 | **2.250** | 0.000 |
| reverse | 1.750 | 1.500 | 0.750 |
| rev∘comp | 1.250 | 1.500 | 0.750 |

## 6. The Second Bridge: 吉×生体 (Probe 8)

### The Shell Channel

The 體/用 five-phase relation — computed for each of 384 (hexagram, line) states by treating the given line as 動爻 — significantly predicts 吉 distribution:

| Relation | n | 吉 | 吉 rate | 凶 | 凶 rate |
|----------|---|---|---------|---|---------|
| 比和 | 84 | 19 | 0.226 | 17 | 0.202 |
| 生体 | 72 | 32 | **0.444** | 5 | 0.069 |
| 体生用 | 72 | 23 | 0.319 | 6 | 0.083 |
| 克体 | 78 | 21 | 0.269 | 11 | 0.141 |
| 体克用 | 78 | 23 | 0.295 | 13 | 0.167 |

**生体** (用 nourishes 體) carries the highest 吉 rate (44.4%), nearly double the 比和 rate (22.6%). The signal is significant: 生体 vs all others, Fisher p=0.007, OR=2.10.

### Basin-Independence (Confirmed)

The 比和→凶 trend raised a confound concern: 比和 hexagrams cluster in fixed-point basins (57.1% vs 50% baseline), where 凶 already concentrates. Basin-controlled tests resolve this:

**生体→吉 survives basin stratification:**

| Basin | 生体 吉 rate | Others 吉 rate | OR | Direction |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| Kun | 46.7% | 25.9% | 2.50 | Same |
| Qian | 40.0% | 27.0% | 1.80 | Same |
| Cycle | 45.2% | 31.3% | 1.82 | Same |

The effect is consistent across all three basins with similar odds ratios (1.80–2.50). It is **not a basin confound** — the signal points *against* what basin composition would predict (生体 is depleted in fixed-point basins, yet carries elevated 吉 regardless).

**比和→凶 is confounded:** The elevated 凶 rate in 比和 (20.2%) is at least partly explained by 比和's enrichment in fixed-point basins. Within-basin tests show a residual tendency (same direction, OR 1.38–2.31) but none are individually significant (all p>0.24). Underpowered.

### The Tradition's Interpolation

The 梅花易數 is explicit: "體用比和，則百事順遂" (比和 = all matters proceed smoothly); "比和為吉克為凶" (比和 IS auspicious, 克 IS inauspicious). The data contradicts this.

The tradition got **one thing right**: 生体→吉 (receiving nourishment is favorable). But it collapsed a directional signal into a symmetric schema:
- **Actual signal**: 生体 (44.4%) ≠ 体生用 (31.9%) for 吉 — *direction matters*
- **Traditional claim**: 比和 = good, 克 = bad — *category matters, direction doesn't*

The error is specifically **symmetrization**: the 生/克 cycle IS directional (σ is a directed cycle on Z₅), but the traditional schema collapses it into three symmetric categories (比和, 生, 克), then assigns valence to categories rather than directions. The texts track the *directed* relation (who generates whom), not the symmetric category (whether generation or overcoming is occurring).

This is a general pattern: later systematization tends to symmetrize directional signals. The 11th c. 梅花 framework projected state-level categories onto texts that encode process-level directionality. The meaning gap is partly this process/state confusion introduced by systematization.

### Updated Bridge Inventory

| Bridge | Channel | Signal | p-value | Independence |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 凶×basin | Core (inner bits) | Convergence → danger | 0.0002 | — |
| 吉×生体 | Shell (trigram elements) | Receiving generation → fortune | 0.007 | Basin-independent (confirmed) |

Both bridges encode **process**: convergence (a process toward stasis) maps to 凶; generation flowing toward the 體 (a process of nourishment) maps to 吉. State-level descriptions (which basin, which element) are the algebra's coordinates but not what the texts track. The texts encode the *direction of flow*, not the *identity of kind*.

## 7. The King Wen Sequence and 序卦 (Probes 6, 9)

### Algebraic Structure of the KW Sequence (Probe 6)

**Basin locality is significant** (38/63 = 60.3% consecutive pairs in same basin, p<0.0001) **but entirely driven by within-pair structure.** KW partners (reversal or complement) tend to preserve basin by construction. Between-pair transitions (even→odd KW numbers) show **no basin locality** (10/31 = 32.3%, p=0.76).

**Depth transitions** are overwhelmingly Δ=0 (51/63 = 81%), but this is partly explained by the 4:12:48 depth distribution (most hexagrams are depth-2).

**Five-phase relations** between consecutive hexagrams are at chance for both upper and lower trigrams (比和 rate: upper p=0.87, lower p=0.79). The KW sequence is element-neutral in its ordering.

**Conclusion:** The King Wen sequence encodes no algebraic walk beyond the pairing rule. The between-pair ordering is algebraically random.

### 序卦 Narrative Classification (Probe 9)

The 63 transition narratives in the 序卦傳 were classified by reasoning type:

| Category | All (63) | Between-pair (31) | Pattern |
|----------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| consequence | 27 | 11 | "X必Y" — X necessarily leads to Y |
| accumulation | 14 | 9 | "然後/而後" — sequential buildup |
| reversal | 12 | 5 | "物不可以終X" — cannot remain X forever |
| negation | 5 | 3 | "不可不/不可以苟" — cannot fail to act |
| origin | 2 | 1 | Cosmogonic framing |
| analogy | 2 | 1 | "莫若" — nothing compares to |

**All four cross-tabulations are null** (between-pair transitions only, n=31):

| Test | χ² | p-value |
|------|-----|---------|
| Category × basin preservation | 6.74 | 0.35 |
| Category × depth direction | 8.89 | 0.71 |
| Category × I-component | 7.89 | 0.25 |
| Category × meeting-point 五行 | 23.4 | 0.49 |

**Reversal narratives** split cleanly: 7/12 are within-pair (where algebraic reversal IS the construction), 5/12 are between-pair (conceptual reversal without algebraic correspondence). The tradition uses the same rhetorical form ("物不可以終X") regardless of whether the transition involves algebraic reversal, complement, or neither.

**Consequence narratives × 生 relations:** No association. Causal reasoning ("X必Y") does not track five-phase 生 relations between trigrams (Fisher p=1.00 for between-pair).

**Conclusion:** The 序卦傳's reasoning operates in a purely semantic register. The narrative logic (reversal, consequence, accumulation) is independent of the algebraic transition properties (basin, depth, element relation). The commentary tradition's explanation for WHY hexagrams are ordered does not encode the mathematical structure of how they relate.

## 8. The Unified Picture: What Does the Hexagram System Model?

### The Instrument, Not the World

The hexagram system is not a model of the world. It is a model of the **constraints on observing** a 6-bit state under complementary projections with temporal modulation. Its structure answers the question: *what can you know, from what angle, at what time?*

### The Architecture

**State space:** Z₂⁶ — 64 hexagrams. The unique balanced factorization into 3+3 (trigram pairs) creates exactly two primitive projections:

1. **Shell** (trigram pair decomposition) → 納甲 → 六親 → 火珠林. Reads identity: what it *is*.
2. **Core** (nuclear overlap) → 互卦 → basins → 梅花. Reads convergence: what it *becomes*.

These are the only two, proven algebraically (closure theorem on Z₂⁶ with 3+3 factorization) and confirmed historically (Chinese sources classify hexagram divination into exactly these two methods).

**Orthogonality — refined:** The orthogonality wall holds at the **納甲 level**: branch assignments factor through trigram *identity*, reading bits [0:2] and [3:5] independently. The 火珠林 operational layer (六親 × 旺相 × 日辰) is perfectly blind to inner-bit dynamics (basin, depth, 凶). However, **trigram elements** (a coarser projection used by 梅花's 體/用 evaluation) share boundary bits (b₂, b₃) with the basin-determining inner space, creating ~7% leakage. The wall's location is at the encoding level (納甲), not the element-projection level (體/用).

**Temporal modulation:** Time enters the two systems at different pipeline stages:
- 梅花 curves the domain: time selects which hexagram is cast
- 火珠林 curves the codomain: time (日辰) selects which aspects are visible

This creates structured incompleteness — the reading is specific to this hexagram, this question, this season, this day.

### The Curvature

Three independent sources of curvature prevent any single reading context from revealing the full hexagram:

| Source | Type | Mechanism | Modifiable? |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Palace incompleteness | Holes | 6/8 palaces lack 2/5 六親 types | No — hexagram-fixed |
| Seasonal ceiling | Torsion | Z₅ rotation forces width-2 window | Softened to 4/5 by 日辰 (theorem) |
| 用神 projection | Reduction | Question collapses 5→1 | No — question-fixed |

The residual curvature (1/5 shadow after 日辰) is the minimal aperture: one element always dark, rotating with the day. The system can illuminate everything except one form of the past — either what gave rise to the present (休) or what the present has already overcome (死). Opposition (囚) is always representable.

### Two Bridges to Meaning

Two narrow channels connect algebraic structure to the oldest textual layer:

**Bridge 1 (Core): Convergence → Danger**
- Algebraic irreversibility (I=0, convergence to absorbing attractor) → textual irreversibility (凶)
- p=0.0002; depth gradient peaks at boundary layer (36.1% at depth-1)
- Never formalized by any tradition — connects structures separated by 700+ years

**Bridge 2 (Shell): Receiving Generation → Fortune**
- 體/用 relation where 用 generates 體 (生体) → elevated 吉 (44.4% vs 27.6%)
- p=0.007; basin-independent (confirmed by stratified analysis)
- Partially recovered by 梅花 tradition, but distorted by symmetrization (比和→吉 is not in the texts)

**What they share:** Both bridges encode *process* — convergence, generation — not *state*. The texts track the direction of flow (who converges where, who generates whom), not the labels on the nodes (which basin, which element). This is the system's "theory of value": fortune is flow, misfortune is stasis.

**What floats free:** Everything else. Semantic content, specific imagery, narrative logic, sequence ordering — all algebraically unconstrained. The algebra provides the grammar (curvature, incompleteness, projection); the texts provide the vocabulary (specific situations, advice, imagery). The grammar constrains which vocabularies are compatible (凶 concentrates at convergence boundaries, 吉 tracks generation flow), but does not determine the specific words.

**The four definitive nulls:**
1. Embedding-space: no algebraic partition predicts textual semantic content (all p>0.4)
2. Thematic content: 凶 texts don't differ by depth category in what they SAY (all p>0.07)
3. KW sequence: between-pair ordering is algebraically random (p=0.76)
4. 序卦 narratives: transition reasoning is independent of algebraic transition types (all p>0.25)

These nulls bound the bridges from above. We know not just where meaning touches algebra, but where it definitively doesn't.

### The Tradition's Interpolation

Later systematization introduces interpretive distortion through **symmetrization of directional signals**. The 生/克 cycle IS directional (σ is a directed cycle on Z₅). The texts track directed relations (生体 ≠ 体生用 for 吉). But the 梅花 tradition collapsed this into symmetric categories (比和 = good, 克 = bad), losing the directional information. The original texts care about *who generates whom*, not *whether generation or overcoming is occurring*.

This process/state confusion is general: the texts encode process (flow direction, convergence trajectory), while later frameworks encode state (element identity, category membership). The gap between original texts and later interpretation is partly this collapse of dynamics into statics.

### Zero Free Parameters

The system has zero structural free parameters (proven in huozhulin workflow). The 乾/坤 position-split is uniquely determined by complement symmetry + fixed-point coherence. The closure to two systems is a theorem. The only genuine design information (1-2 bits) is in the 五行↔trigram element mapping, and even this is constrained to top 1.2% of possible partitions by compass alignment.

The system was discovered, not designed.

## 9. What Remains Open

### Resolved by this workflow

**Q1 (decisive test):** MIXED — two narrow bridges. The algebra is partially descriptive (凶×basin through core, 吉×生体 through shell) but not fully — deeper constructs (kernel, 互卦, palace) don't predict textual semantics. Both bridges encode process (convergence, generation), not state.

**Q4 (breaking the ceiling):** POSITIVE. 日辰 breaks 2/5 → 4/5 (theorem). Orthogonality wall untouched at 納甲 level. Pipeline asymmetry: 梅花 curves domain, 火珠林 curves codomain.

**Q2 (curvature):** PARTIALLY RESOLVED. Contextual obstruction measured — F_total = 12 conservation law, orthogonality wall confirmed at 納甲 level (refined: leaks at element level). Formal H¹ computation not done but the structural picture is clear: three independent curvature sources, none eliminable, now characterized.

**Q5 (用神 mapping):** FORMALIZED. The 用神 projection is structured by the 六親 生/克 cycle. Auxiliary = σ⁻¹, 忌神 = 克-preimage. 兄弟 (self) excluded as reference frame with 0 domains. Domain weighting 8:7:4:3:0 creates differential darkness. Temporal treatment uniform (2/5 suppression). Triad diagnostic gradient: 45.3% full / 19.9% blind / 34.8% degraded. Gen palace darkest (68% of domains unreadable).

**Q6 (S₄ × 五行):** RESOLVED. Complement is an anti-automorphism of the 五行 cycle (π∘σ∘π⁻¹ = σ⁻¹). Preserves parity universally. Preserves 比/生/克 category (0% disruption). Semantic gap tracks concrete identity, not abstract relational structure. MI: 0.750 bits lost = within-pair identity (Layer 2), cosmological choice (Layer 3) preserved. Wood = fixed point of anti-automorphism.

**Q7 (shell bridge):** POSITIVE. 吉×生体 is a genuine second bridge (p=0.007, OR=2.10, basin-independent). The 梅花 tradition partially recovered it but distorted it through symmetrization. 比和→凶 trend is confounded with basin and underpowered.

**Q8 (凶 content at boundary):** NULL. The 凶×basin signal is distributional (WHERE 凶 appears), not thematic (WHAT 凶 says). No word category differentiates by depth at α=0.05.

**Q9 (KW sequence):** NULL. Between-pair ordering is algebraically random. Basin locality is entirely within-pair. 序卦 narrative reasoning is independent of algebraic transitions (all p>0.25).

### Still open

**H¹ computation.** All three curvature sources are now quantified. A formal H¹ computation would test whether curvature varies with basin, palace rank, or 互 depth. Lower priority given the orthogonality wall — the shell-layer presheaf cannot see core-layer dynamics.

**Is the curvature optimized?** Does the specific combination of Z₅ torsion + palace holes + 用神 projection maximize discriminative power for some natural measure? Or is any nonzero curvature sufficient? No natural measure of "discriminative power" has been identified to optimize against.

**The 納甲 modification.** 京氏易傳 uses universal upper trigram offset +3 (63/63 match). 火珠林 modified to 乾/坤-only, gaining one unique 六親 word (58→59/64). When and why did this modification occur? Historical question requiring textual survey of intermediate sources (唐–宋).

Exactly. The hexagram is a snapshot — 6 bits, a frozen state. The divination transforms it into a network of directed flows.                      
                                                                                                                                                  
**State → Relations → Active relations → Your relation**                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                  
The snapshot tells you nothing by itself. "Lines 1,3,4 are yang, lines 2,5,6 are yin" is just a pattern. The divination pipeline is:              
                                                                                                                                                  
1. **What is the situation?** → hexagram (static, 6 bits)                                                                                         
2. **What are the components?** → 納甲 gives each line an element (still static, but now typed)                                                   
3. **Who is doing what to whom?** → 六親 maps elements to relational roles on Z₅ (now directional: generating, controlling, yielding, threatening)
4. **Which flows are active now?** → season/日辰 filters which relations have force right now (temporal)                                          
5. **Which flow matters to you?** → 用神 selects the one relation relevant to your question (intentional)                                         
                                                                                                                                                  
The output isn't "you are in hexagram 23." The output is: "the thing threatening you is strong this season, the thing that could protect you is   
absent, and the thing you're trying to control is weakened by today's branch."                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                  
From a point in Z₂⁶ to a story about flows on Z₅. From *what is* to *what is becoming what, and who has power over whom*.                         
                                                                                                                                                  
And the deepest finding confirms this is what the texts always encoded. 凶 = flow stopping (convergence to fixed point). 吉 = flow arriving (receiving generation). The system's value judgment is: flow is good, stasis is dangerous. The divination reads a situation not for what it is, but for where it's going and whether the flows sustain or collapse.

 > 6 elements to  5 transformations

Six lines. Five relation types. The sixth line doesn't add a sixth type — it creates a *duplicate*. Somewhere on the Z₅ ring, two lines occupy the same relational position.

1. **Line → 干支** (納甲, Step 3)
2. **干支 → branch element** (each line gets one element from its 地支)                       
3. **Branch element vs palace element** → 六親 (Step 4)                                    
4. **Filter by season** → 旺相休囚死 per element (Step 7)              
5. **Filter by question** → 用神 selects which 六親 type to focus on (Step 8)

火珠林 takes 6 *line-level* samples of Z₅ simultaneously. It asks: what's the relational landscape right now? All 6 probes active at once,        
filtered by time and question.           

梅花 takes 4-5 *trigram-level* samples of Z₅ sequentially. It asks: what's the relational trajectory? Each sample is a different *depth layer*:

Each layer yields one relation to 體 on Z₅. The reading is: 用 generates 體 (present nourishes you) but 互 克 體 (hidden structure threatens) and 
變 generates 體 (outcome favorable). A *trajectory through Z₅ relations*, not a snapshot.
